# Performance Compare

## Facts

Test1 is around 70000ms in average, Test2 is 3500-7100ms and Test3 is stable approx 3500ms. Apparently the performance rank is Test3 > Test2 > Test1

## Conclusion

Test1 offers a basic thread-safe implementation with potential high contention, which influence the performance. Test2 improves upon this by distributing the counter across multiple buckets, reducing contention. Test3 is similar to Tes2 but adding padding to each bucket to prevent false sharing, potentially enhancing performance in multithreaded environments.

## Evaluation

I don't think it would be the same result in different computer.

For example, The performance gain from using multiple buckets (Test2 and Test3) is more pronounced on systems with more CPU cores. On systems with fewer cores, the advantage of reducing contention might be less noticeable.

Also different CPUs have different cache line sizes, and the hardcoded padding size may not be optimal for all architectures. In Test3, the padding is to prevent false sharing depends on the cache line size of the CPU.

## Why do I like jthreads?

In "jthread" version, when the vector goes out of scope at the end of , all objects in the vector will be destructed, which will automatically join each thread.There is no need for the loop to join threads, as jthreads will automatically join on destruction
